 ## This is a project 00 for GA course

 ### Link to live site

 ## Big Goals

1. Build a web application from scratch, without a starter codebase
2. Use your programming skills to map out the game logic for a simple game like Tic Tac Toe
3. Separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in your application
4. Build an application to a spec that someone else gives you
5. Build a dynamic game that allows two players to compete
6. Craft a readme.md file that explains your app to the world

## Technical Requirements

### Your app must:

1. Render a game board in the browser
Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
2. Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
3. Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
4. Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
5. Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
6. Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

#TODO:
1. make green squares (wining combo) disappear when we click on “New Game” button
2. Implement the strike through effect when the winning combo is announced on the whole line of winning combos, as opposed to just one item (its doing it atm)
3. fix the little margins and paddings around the document
4. Center the button “newGame” properly
5. Fix the message board’s width so it doesn’t span to the screen’s width
